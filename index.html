      <h3>Extraversion/Introversion</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Extrovert</h4>
        <p>
          We learned an extrovert is an outgoing, overtly expressive person. We
          also learned that extroverts enjoy being in large group discussions.
          They enjoy working in open spaces and they are confident to speak to
          anyone. Extroverts make more friends but less strong bonds and they
          make decisions quickly. After learning more about extroverts we
          invited extroverts to larger group discussions as they perform the
          best when sharing their ideas will lots of people.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Introvert</h4>
        <p>
          We learned that an introvert is a shy, reticent person and they
          recharge by spending time alone. They enjoy one on one conversation
          and enjoy working in quiet spaces. Introverts reflect before making a
          decision and they share ideas promptly. Introverts are also great
          listeners and love to hear other peoples' ideas and will give fewer
          ideas compared to extroverts, but with much deeper thought. Now we do
          not turn away from introverts when searching for group members because
          they also can bring a lot to the table.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Ambivert</h4>
        <p>
          A person whose personality has a balance of extrovert and introvert
          features. We learned that an ambivert is someone who exhibits
          qualities of both introversion and extroversion, and can flip into
          either depending on their mood, context, and goals. We learned
          Ambiverts have lots of great traits. They're able to be flexible in a
          variety of situations, often knowing when to talk and when to listen.
        </p>

    <div class="container reveal" id="Leadership">
      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        It is the ability to influence a group towards the achievement of goals.
        We learned that leaders can influence an individual. We learned to use
        leadership to lead a project or task in school. This can be any level of
        school or work, organising a study group or Volunteer/non-profit
        leadership. There are many different types of leadership and leadership
        can be narrowed down. After learning more about leadership we improved
        our leadership skills and are now far better at things like leading
        group descussions and assigning tasks to others.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container reveal" id="Negotiation">
      <h3>Negotiation</h3>
      <p>
        We learned that negotiation, often known as bargaining, is a process in
        which two or more parties exchange products or services and attempt to
        agree on a rate of exchange. Negotiation can take many different shapes,
        and different cultures use different methods. A great process for
        negotiation is developing a strategy and ground rules, clarifying and
        justifying, bargaining and problem solving and finally closing and
        implementing. After expanding our knowledge about negotiation we are
        better at negotiating and creating a win-win situation where both
        parties are satisfied.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container reveal" id="Conflicts">
      <h3>Conflicts</h3>
      <p>
        A conflict is when there are two parties are in disagreement. We learned
        that there are two different types of conflict; Cognitive Conflict is
        when one's beliefs, attitudes, or behaviours contradict one another.
        Affective conflict happens when two parties realise that their
        sentiments and emotions about some or all of the issues are conflicting
        while attempting to solve a problem together. We also learned that not
        all conflicts are neccesarily bad, and some conflicts can help the group
        achieve its objectives and improve its performance while others can
        obstruct a group's performance. Now when we run into conflicts we do not
        always see it as a bad thing and we can use conflicts positivily.
